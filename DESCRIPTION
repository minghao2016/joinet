Title: Multivariate Elastic Net Regression
Description: Implements high-dimensional multivariate regression by stacked generalisation (Wolpert 1992 <doi:10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80023-1>). For positively correlated outcomes, a single multivariate regression is typically more predictive than multiple univariate regressions. Includes functions for model fitting, extracting coefficients, outcome prediction, and performance measurement.
Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)
